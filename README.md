# About Bilge-NLP

> *Inspired by the wisdom etched in stone by Bilge Khagan, this project aims to unlock the linguistic secrets of Old Turkic using modern Natural Language Processing techniques.*

**Bilge-NLP** is an open-source initiative to build a complete toolkit for the computational analysis of the language of the Turkic inscriptions.

## Our Core Goals

### 1. Create a Standardized Digital Corpus  
Gather and standardize transcriptions of the **Orkhon**, **Yenisey**, and other **Old Turkic inscriptions** into a machine-readable format.

### 2. Develop Core NLP Tools  
Build foundational tools including:
- A rule-based tokenizer  
- A morphological analyzer  
- A Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger  
- A lemmatizer  
...specifically designed for Old Turkic.

### 3. Bridge Disciplines  
Create a resource that empowers:
- **Turkologists** without a computer science background  
- **NLP researchers** unfamiliar with historical linguistics

## Our Vision
To make **Old Turkic** a *computationally accessible language*, paving the way for new research in **Digital Humanities** and **Computational Linguistics**.
